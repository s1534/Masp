# MASP PROJECT

This is a new Flutter project, to support people in "New Nomal" society.

# Background

## "Covit-19" and our society
The 2019 outbreak of novel coronavirus infections has left many disasters, but society has begun to move toward containment in recent years

## the Mask Society
Among the changes that the new coronavirus infection has brought about in society, one of the most significant is the shift to a mask society.

The status of masks has changed from being something that "people who are sick wear" to something that "must be worn.

## The "New Nomal society"
However, these days, with the advance of vaccination and society moving into the "new normal society", masks are no longer necessarily required.

In fact, in some countries, such as Israel, the requirement to wear masks has been lifted.

## New Challenge in the New Nomal society
On the other hand, it is also true that the risk of infection still exists.

We considered that the challenge of our time, which is changing into the era of the new normal with the convergence of coronas, is to provide information that will serve as a basis for users to decide where they should wear masks and where they can take them off.

# Our Proposal "Masp"
We have therefore developed Masp, a user-participatory application that provides information on masks.

This app has two main functions: one is to allow users to vote on whether or not they think people should wear masks in their own neighborhoods, and the other is to display a graph showing what people in the places they want to visit think about masks.

## Contribution
・This is the basis for determining whether you should wear a mask when traveling or going out.

・This provides an opportunity to find out what people in your community think about masks.

・Uses can immediately access Corona information for the municipality in which you live.

・This can also be used to analyze the awareness of wearing masks and the actual number of infected persons.\n
